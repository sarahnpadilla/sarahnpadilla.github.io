        <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Sarah Padilla, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from UC Merced 
    with a passion for building innovative solutions at the intersection of software 
    development and network infrastructure. Currently working as an IT/Audio/Visual Technician 
    at Berkeley Community Media, I bring hands-on experience in troubleshooting complex 
    systems, developing web applications, and implementing secure network solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    My expertise spans full-stack web development, database systems, and network security, 
    with a strong foundation in Python, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like Flask and 
    React. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can apply my technical skills to 
    solve real-world problems and create meaningful user experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, working on personal 
    projects, or contributing to solutions that make a positive social impact.
